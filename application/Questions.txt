Why do you enjoy teaching math?



Mathematics is a deep subject with far reach and multitude of uses. It emphasizes precise and unambiguous methods that address real world problems. I enjoy my role as an educator, communicating the material through visual aid, applications, and examples. My primary goal is to present math as a vibrant, intuitive, and interesting subject breaking its typical perception as a dry and formal area of study.  A student wrote: "With you as my professor I felt like you really cared and showed interest in me which was huge. Knowing I had someone who believed in me really made me want to dig deep and put my full effort into the class." I am very proud of a review like this and strive to keep discovering new ways of communicating the material and further refining my teaching techniques.



Tell us about a class session that did not go well and why. How might you improve it next time?



A teaching session that is below my standards is one where there is little interaction between me and the students. When I started teaching I would often have classes where I would just talk for one hour without any feedback or questions. That makes the lecture very boring. There are several techniques I use to avoid situations like that:

* I prepare worksheets or short group assignments so that the students spend at least 10 minutes interacting with each other and working through simple problems which I can then explain and build on.

* When I design my lectures I make sure to include plenty of examples. A typical example would start from a simple question I would ask the students and then proceeds from there into more a complex computation. Instead of working through simple computations myself I would ask the students to give the answer.

* The class I am currently teaching has a short write-up due every lecture. This way the very first thing I do in a lecture is discuss answers different students gave. I follow by building up on that material to move into the main topic of the lecture.

* I always make sure to include plenty of visual demonstrations into the course. This mixes up the pace of the lecture and keeps the students engaged.

* From time to time I administer text message polls with a simple question to see where the students are at.



Describe either an article you read, a conference you attended, or a professional development activity that had a positive impact on how you teach.



I have read an article on IBL (inquiry-based learning), which has made a big impact on my teaching style. Inquiry-based learning structures the course so that students are discovering the materials themselves, starting from simple problems and then working up toward harder concepts. It emphasizes instructor's role to only guide overall direction of the class, while the students would be discovering the material on their own through the natural process of problem solving, asking questions, and trying to generalize the concepts they encounter. I have never attempted an entire inquiry-based class, however when lecturing I keep in mind the power and impact of a student's own discovery of the material. I always try to have as much interaction and comments as possible when building up to a particularly hard topic. If a topic can be explained via a visual demonstration or a group assignment, I do that instead of presenting it directly. Lecturing this way ensures that the material stays with the student long after they have completed the course.
