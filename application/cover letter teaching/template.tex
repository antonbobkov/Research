I am a PhD student in logic at UCLA. I will graduate in June 2017 and would like to apply for #3 beginning in Fall 2017#4

My work at UCLA has exposed me to a variety of teaching techniques which helped me to define and improve a style of my own while addressing the diverse undergraduate student body.
I have taught in both first-year calculus classes and advanced undergraduate math classes as well as other areas such as programming and finance.
I have worked with a large number of students with different skill levels, majors, and background knowledge.
My teaching style has adjusted based on the requirements of the class and of the students.
I was honored to receive the 2016 Distinguished Teaching Award from the UCLA Mathematics Department.
On top of my teaching duties I was closely involved in mentoring undergraduate students doing independent study.
I oversaw a variety of projects guiding and advising the students along the way.
I look forward to working at #6, exchanging ideas with my colleagues and further refining my teaching techniques.
