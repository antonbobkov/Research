  {I'm always on the lookout for new ways to communicate the material and interact with the students. When possible I try to use technology and online visualization tools in my classes. By fostering interaction and group work I strive to make my classroom an active learning environment. This is what makes this position at the University of Delaware particularly exciting to me. I'm committed to teaching and developing my teaching techniques all throughout my career.}
