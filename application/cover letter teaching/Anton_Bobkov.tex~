\def\teachliberalart{{The idea of teaching in a liberal arts college is particularly exciting to me.
With large class sizes at UCLA I didn't have the opportunity to intimately work with the students as much as I would have liked to.
I value the individual student-teacher bond.
It empowers the student to realize their full potential and it allows the teacher to relearn the material from a student's perspective providing valuable insights into where the common misunderstandings lie.
I'm really looking forward to an opportunity to work more closely with the students in a setting of a smaller classroom.
I strongly believe that it will help me grow as an educator.
