\opening{#2} % #2= Dear so-and so:

I am a PhD student in logic at UCLA. I will graduate in June 2017 and would like to apply for #3 beginning in 2017#4 At UCLA I was exposed to a variety of teaching techniques which helped me to define and improve a teaching style of my own addressing the diverse undergraduate student body at UCLA.

%#3 = name of position, or \position for generic
%#4 = \mathjobs, \website, \nopost, \notopol{field}, or something else beginning with a punctuation mark.

#5 %\workwith{School}{Topologists} or more specific information.

I have taught in both first-year calculus classes and advanced undergraduate classes as well as other fields such as programming and finance.
This has exposed me to a large body of students with different skill levels, majors, and background knowledge.
My teaching style has adjusted based on the requirements of the class and of the students.
I was honored to receive the 2016 Distinguished Teaching Award from the UCLA Mathematics Department.
On top of my teaching duties I was closely involved in mentoring undergraduate students doing independent study.
I oversaw a variety of projects guiding and advising the students along the way.
% I would be excited to work in #6 and to collaborate with my colleagues, exchange ideas and further refine my teaching techniques. 

The idea of teaching in a liberal arts college is particularly exciting to me.
With large class sizes at UCLA I didn't have the opportunity to intimately work with the students as much as I would have liked to.
I value the individual student-teacher bond.
It empowers the student to realize their full potential and it allows the teacher to relearn the material from a student's perspective providing valuable insights into where the common misunderstandings lie.
At #6 I'm really looking forward to an opportunity to work more closely with the students in a setting of a smaller classroom.
I strongly believe that it will help me grow as an educator.

%#7 = list of contents. \generic, \genericplusapp, \genericpluspreprints
My application consists of #7. In addition, it includes letters of reference
from my advisor, Matthias Aschenbrenner, as well as from Artem Chernikov and Olga Radko.
Dr.~Radko's letter addresses my teaching experience.

Please let me know if any of these items is not accessible or if I can provide
any further information.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  I look forward to talking with you.

\closing{Sincerely, \\ Anton Bobkov}
