\begin{document}

As UCLA student I had a wide variety of teaching experience, 
having taught in first-year calculus classes, advanced undergraduate classes, programming courses
as well as mentoring independent projects and reading courses for undergraduate students.
I was a recipient of UCLA's 2016 Departmental Teaching Award.
I have also engaged in private tutoring as well as volunteering to assist math instructors in local high schools.

When I teach, my primary goal is to have students interacting with the material as soon as possible.
Instead of waiting for them to first engage with the material only when they start their homework,
I give out worksheets as soon as a given topic as covered.
This way they get familiar with the basics faster which allows me to move on to harder topics and
give more abstract explanations sooner.
Having a class work on an assignment right away also allows me to gauge where all the students are at in their understanding of the material.
I encourage group work when possible.
This empahsizes a social aspect of learning and allows students to interact with their peers to explain ideas and help each other to work trough harder parts of the material.

I believe that mathematics is best explained with the use of visual aid.
I make sure to include plenty of diagrams, pictures, and graphs in my teaching.
When possible I try to illustrate common mathematical or physical concepts using props.
For example, as a part of explanation of sorting algorithms I use a deck of cards,
or when explaining hyperbolic function I use a hanging rope as an illustration of catenoid.
This helps students to visualize explained concepts as well as creating a link to the real world application of the presented abstract concepts.

When teaching I strive to get as much student feedback as possible.
For example, I always ask students attending office hours what they think of the direction the class is going and what they would like to see more.
I also ask them to fill out an anonymous survey at several points throughout the class where they can voice criticisms and suggestions.
I do my best to respond and adapt my teaching style according to this feedback - it has greatly helped me to form my teaching style.

I have volunteered to be an independent study mentor for several students.
They were working on a variety of projects

At UCLA, I worked as a mentor for students doing independent study.
This has encompassed a wide variety of projects.
I have worked with students both informally and formally for university credit,
over short periods like one quarter as well as on more serious year long projects.
The projects' topics included pure and applied math, data analysis, computer science, and finance.
All the projects had a strong programming component, so students always had a working program to show at the end.

My main focus as a mentor was to balance encouraging students to explore on their own versus providing a structure with concrete goals and expectations.
On one hand I would let students learn different aspects of the material, experiment with it, and see what direction they want to take their project.
Given complexity and range of the material, however, it is easy for the students to feel overwhelmed.
To counter that I would introduce concrete weekly goals and would often check in to talk about long term direction of the project.
This way even if the material is dense and frustrating to get through, the student would always feel accomplished having a concrete weekly progress as well as a feel for project's overall progress.

For example, one of the projects was doing image recognition of digits using neural networks.
The student didn't have any prior experience in this area, so we started really slowly by following tutorials online.
I would instruct to get a tutorial working, make minor changes to it, and research what other algorithms there are.
As we progressed, the student became more familiar with the language and the code involved, gaining confidence to work on more advanced topics.
Originally we have planned to write an algorithm recognizing chineese characters,
but as we got through the basics, I have talked to the student and we have determined that it would be more interesting to try to adapt symbol recognition algorithm to recognizing sounds
I value this flexibility a lot - it allows the project to evolve naturally in accord with the student's interest and their comfort with the material studied.
