I am a Ph.D. student in algebraic number theory at UCLA studying with Haruzo Hida. I will be graduating in June 2016 and would like to apply for #3 beginning in the Fall
of 2016#4

%#3 = name of position, or \position for generic
%#4 = \mathjobs, \website, \nopost, \notopol{field}, or something else beginning with a punctuation mark.


In my thesis, I study images of Galois representation associated to Hida families of modular forms.  I prove that, in the non-CM case, the images of such Galois representations are appropriately large, an analogue of a classical theorem by Ribet and Momose.  One of the key steps is a lifting theorem, which I prove using a combination of deformation theory and automorphic techniques.  For more detailed information, please see my research statement.  #5 %\workwith{School}{Number Theorists} or more specific information.

%While at UCLA, I have been a successful teacher, both in the classroom and while working with individual students.  I was honored to receive a Distinguished Teaching Award in 2014 from the UCLA Mathematics Department, based on evaluations from students and faculty members.

%My application consists of #7. In addition, it includes letters of reference from my advisor, Haruzo Hida, and from Jacques Tilouine, Chandrashekhar Khare, and Olga Radko.  Dr.~Radko's letter addresses my teaching experience.  Please let me know if any of these items is not accessible or if I can provide any further information.  Thank you for your consideration.
