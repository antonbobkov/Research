I am a Ph.D. student in algebraic number theory at UCLA. I will graduate in June 2016 and would like to apply for #3 beginning in the Fall
of 2016#4  As an undergraduate at Bryn Mawr, my professors embodied the teacher-scholar ideal.  They were my role models through graduate school as I developed my research program while honing my teaching skills to address the diverse undergraduate student body at UCLA.


%#3 = name of position, or \position for generic
%#4 = \mathjobs, \website, \nopost, \notopol{field}, or something else beginning with a punctuation mark.


My research is in the area of algebraic number theory.  The main result of my thesis, which concerns the size of images of certain Galois representations, is under review at \textit{Algebra and Number Theory}.  Furthermore, as part of the Women in Numbers 3 Workshop my collaborators and I developed an algorithm that to compute the first examples of “shadow lines” - a certain invariant associated to elliptic curves.  Our paper will appear in the peer-reviewed conference proceedings.  One of my future research projects will combine computation and Galois representations, a project on which I would like to work with undergraduate researchers.  

#5 %\workwith{School}{Topologists} or more specific information.

I am committed to advocating for and supporting underrepresented minorities in mathematics through my teaching and mentoring.  In 2012 I was a teaching assistant and mentor for the Summer Program for Women in Mathematics at George Washington University, a program for undergraduate women majoring in math from around the country.  I was honored to receive the 2014 Distinguished Teaching Award from the UCLA Mathematics Department.  As a Teaching Assistant Consultant at UCLA, I developed curriculum to teach new TAs about pedagogy, including a guest lecture on stereotype threat from a professor of social psychology.  
#6

%#7 = list of contents. \generic, \genericplusapp, \genericpluspreprints
My application consists of #7. In addition, it includes letters of reference
from my advisor, Haruzo Hida, and from Jacques Tilouine, Chandrashekhar Khare, and Olga Radko.  Dr.~Radko's letter addresses my teaching experience.

Please let me know if any of these items is not accessible or if I can provide
any further information.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  I look forward to talking with you.
