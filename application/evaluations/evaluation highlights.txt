I felt like anything that was unclear from the instructor was cleared up during the class discussion (and sometimes that was a lot!). He had the ability to teach us an entire week's worth of information in just 30-40 minutes.

His teaching is a large part of my success in the course.

He explains topics thoroughly and easily shows anecdotes and applications to make concepts more understandable. He answers questions fluidly and without hesitation, and shows that he really knows his math.

I really appreciate how he asked for feedback and then responded and improved.

Sections were always well-organized, with a clear lesson plan and instructive examples.

He is very helpful during office hours and explains things very clearly, and we never have trouble getting a hold of him outside of class hours if we have questions.

I think Anton is incredibly knowledgable, and fairly distributes his time amongst his students. He was always very quick to respond to emails, never judged a student or showed disinterest in tutoring them if they indicated they were behind.
