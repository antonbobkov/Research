UCLA has a large and diverse undergraduate student body. As a teacher assistant and instructor I have interacted with many students, many from underrepresented groups. I make sure that all students feel welcome in my class regardless of their background or their skill level. If a student is behind, I make sure to work more closely with them, spend more time in office hours, and encourage the student to continue with the course. This way I try to foster an atmosphere where all the students are encouraged to work to their full potential and succeed.

I have also volunteered to work with math students in a local Los Angeles school from a predominantly Latina district. I was helping the students to catch up on their basic math skills. On the other end of the academic spectrum, I have attended the MSRI workshop "Connections for Women: Model Theory and Its Interactions with Number Theory and Arithmetic Geometry". The main topic was addressing diversity in academia and steps to increase representation of minority groups in high-level academia positions.

As I go forward I hope to further work on outreach and increasing the diversity in STEM fields.
