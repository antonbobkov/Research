I am a PhD student studying logic at UCLA.
I will graduate in June 2017 and would like to apply for #3 beginning in Fall 2017#4
At UCLA I was exposed to a rigorous level of academic expectation.
I have interacted with a diverse Logic Group as well as excellect mathematics educators.
With this I was able to develop my research program while improving my teaching skills to address the diverse undergraduate student body at UCLA.


%#3 = name of position, or \position for generic
%#4 = \mathjobs, \website, \nopost, \notopol{field}, or something else beginning with a punctuation mark.

My research is in the area of model theory specializing in VC-dimension and VC-density.
The main result of my thesis is an improvement of a bound for vc-function in a reduct of $p$-adic numbers.
My other work concerns VC-density computations in Shelah-Spencer graphs and trees in a language of partial order.
My future research projects involve adapting my techniques to valued fields, RV sorts and families of flat graphs.

At #6, I would be excited to work with #5, as well as with other logicians in the department.

I have taught in both first-year calculus classes and advanced undergraduate classes as well as other fields such as programming and finance.
This has exposed me to a large body of students with different skill levels, majors, and background knowledge.
My teaching style has adjusted based on the requirements of the class and of the students.
I was honored to receive the 2016 Distinguished Teaching Award from the UCLA Mathematics Department.
On top of my teaching duties I was closely involved in mentoring undergraduate students doing independent study.
I oversaw a variety of projects guiding and advising the students along the way.
I would be excited to work in #6 and to collaborate with my colleagues, exchange ideas and further refine my teaching techniques. 


%#7 = list of contents. \generic, \genericplusapp, \genericpluspreprints
My application consists of #7. In addition, it includes letters of reference
from my advisor, Matthias Aschenbrenner, as well as from Artem Chernikov and Olga Radko.
Dr.~Radko's letter addresses my teaching experience.

Please let me know if any of these items is not accessible or if I can provide
any further information.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  I look forward to talking with you.

\closing{Sincerely, \\ Anton Bobkov}
