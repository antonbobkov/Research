Timeline:

I propose a start date of October 2016.

March through September 2016

I will prepare and submit papers on my results for trees and Shelah-Spencer graphs. I will research families of flat graphs to see which of my techniques apply in that setting. I will generalize my result for valued fields from one dimension to multiple dimensions. I will also use this time to attend conferences to discuss my results with other mathematicians and get advice on further applications of my research.

October 2016

I will research p-adic number reducts and RV sorts to see if my valued field techniques apply.

November 2016

I will prepare and submit a paper containing my results for p-adic numbers and valued fields. I will continue exploring other valued field constructions to see if my techniques would apply to those as well.

December 2016

I will write an introduction to my thesis, defining VC-density and summarizing known results and computations.

January 2017

I will write the first chapter of my thesis on Shelah-Spencer graphs.

February 2017

I will write the second chapter of my thesis on trees and flat graphs.

March 2017

I will write the third and final chapter of my thesis on p-adic numbers and valued fields. At the end of the month I will submit the thesis to my advisor.

April 2017

I will make revisions to my thesis suggested by my advisor and submit the thesis to my committee. I will start preparing for the defense.

May 2017

I will implement revisions to my thesis given by my committee and resubmit the final version. I will complete the defense.
