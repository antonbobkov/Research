I am a fifth-year graduate student at UCLA studying model theory with Pr. Matthias Aschenbrenner. My research concentrates on NIP theories,  p-adic numbers, and VC-density. This conference is a great opportunity for me to get exposed to the latest results in tame geometry. My next year will be the last year before graduation, so the conference will allow me to share my existing work, and get advice on application of my results before I start putting together my dissertation.

My name is Anton Bobkov, and I'm applying for travel awards for Summer School in Tame Geometry in Konstanz that will be held July 18 – 23. I am a fifth-year graduate student at UCLA studying model theory with Pr. Matthias Aschenbrenner. He will be sending a recommendation letter shortly. I am a US citizen. I estimate my travel cost to be around $1300, of which $550 is covered by the summer school.

My research concentrates on NIP theories,  p-adic numbers, and VC-density. I work on computing new VC-density bounds and improving the existent ones for combinatorial and geometric NIP structures. I am able to show simple bounds for VC-density in partial order tree structure as well as some upper bounds in Shelah-Spencer graphs. Recently my work concentrated on p-adic numbers and valued fields. I am able to compute a simple VC-density bound for a certain additive reductive p-adic numbers as well as estimate VC-density of a valued field in terms of its value group and its residue field.

This conference is a great opportunity for me to learn more about geometric methods in model theory, algebraic geometry, and techniques used in o-minimal setting. I hope to find applications of my research in those areas as well as further directions for investigation of VC-density. My next year will be the last year before graduation, so the summer school will allow me to share my existing work, and get advice on application of my results before I start putting together my dissertation.
