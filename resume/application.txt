Introduction:

The concept of VC-dimension was first introduced in 1971 by Vapnik and Chervonenkis for set systems in probabilistic setting. The theory grew rapidly and found wide use in geometric combinatorics, in particular when applied to semi-algebraic sets. Around the same time Shelah was developing a notion of NIP, a natural property of structures in the model theory. In 1992 Laskowski noticed the connection between the two, theories with uniformly definable families of sets of finite VC-dimension turned out to be exactly NIP theories. It is a wide class of structures including algebraically closed fields, differentially closed fields, modules, free groups, o-minimal structures, and ordered abelian groups. A variety of valued fields fall into this category as well, including p-adic numbers.

P-adic numbers were first introduced by Hensel in 1897, and over the following century a powerful theory was developed with numerous applications across a variety of disciplines including physics and computer science. In 1965 Ax, Kochen and Ershov axiomatized the theory of p-adic numbers and proved a quantifier elimination result. Key feature was connecting properties of the value group and residue field to the properties of the valued field itself. In 1984 Denef proved a cell decomposition result for more general valued fields. It was set up in a different language, with extra sorts for value group and residue field as well as an angular component map. This result was soon generalized to rigid analytic and p-adic subanalytic extensions for, allowing for a development of a more powerful technique of motivic integration. Conjunction of those model theoretic results allowed to solve a number of outstanding open problems in number theory.

In 1997, Karpinski and Macintyre computed VC-density bounds for o-minimal structures and asked about similar bounds for p-adic numbers. VC-density is a concept closely related to VC-dimension. It comes up naturally in combinatorics with relation to packings, Hamming metric, entropic dimension and discrepancy. In model theoretic setting it is computed for families of uniformly definable sets.  In 2013, Aschenbrenner, Dolich, Haskell, Macpherson, and Starchenko computed a bound for VC-density in p-adic numbers as well as number of other NIP structures. They observed connections to dp-rank and dp-minimality, notions first introduced by Shelah. My research is concentrating on improving those bounds and adapting those techniques to compute VC-density in other common NIP structures.

Some of the other well behaved NIP structures are Shelah-Spencer graphs and flat graphs. Shelah-Spencer graphs are random graphs arising naturally in combinatorial context. Their model theory was studied by [Baldwin-Shi ’96], [Baldwin-Shelah ’97], with [Laskowski ’06] providing a quantifier elimination result.  Flat graphs were first studied by Podewski-Ziegler in 1978, showing that those are stable, and later results gave a criterion for super stability. Those are subclasses of NIP theories, extremely well behaved model theoretically.

Research plan:

First chapter of my dissertation concentrates on Shelah-Spencer graphs. In [2] I show that they have infinite dp-rank, so they are poorly behaved as NIP structures. I also show that one can obtain arbitrarily high VC-density when looking at uniformly definable families in a fixed dimension. However I'm able to bound VC-density of individual formulas in terms of edge density of the graphs they define.

Second chapter of my dissertation concentrates on graphs and graph-like structures. In [1] I answer an open question from Aschenbrenner et al., computing VC-density for trees viewed as a partial order. Main idea is to adapt a technique of Parigot to partition trees into weakly interacting parts, with simple bounds of VC-density on each. Similar partitions come up in Podewski-Ziegler analysis of flat graphs. I am able to use that technique to show that flat graphs are dp-minimal, an important first step before establishing bounds on VC-density. The first of my remaining research goals is to apply this partition to compute VC-densities for specific families of flat graphs.

Third chapter of my dissertation deals with p-adic numbers and valued fields. In [3] I show that VC-density is trivial for an additive reduct of p-adic numbers, one of the reducts described in [Leenknegt, 2013]. I will explore other reducts described in that paper, to see if my techniques apply to those as well. In [3] I also show that in Henselian valued fields of eqi-characteristic zero, trivial one-dimensional VC-density in residue field and value group imply trivial one-dimensional VC-density in the valued field, a result along the lines of Ax-Kochen . The second of my remaining research goals is to apply those techniques to higher dimensions, as well as applying them to RV sorts introduced by [Flenner, 2011].

My dissertation will therefore consist of VC-density computations for partial order trees, Shelah-Spencer graphs, flat graphs, and various valued fields, as well as any additional applications I am able to find after discussion with my advisor and my colleagues.
