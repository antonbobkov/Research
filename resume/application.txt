The concept of VC-dimension was introduced in 1971 by Vapnik and Chervonenkis for said systems in probabilistic setting. The theory grew rapidly and found wide use in combinatorics, especially when applied to semi-algebraic sets. Around the same time Shelah was developing a notion of NIP, a wide class of structures studied in model theory. In 1992 Laskowski noticed the connection between the two, theories with uniformly definable families of sets of finite VC-dimension turned out to be exactly NIP theories. P-adic numbers is one of the most natural examples of NIP theories.

P-adic numbers were first introduced by Hensel in 1897, and soon a powerful theory was developed with numerous applications across a variety of disciplines including physics and computer science. In 1965 Ax, Kochen and Ershov axiomatized the theory of p-adic numbers and proved a quantifier elimination result. In 1984 Denef proved a cell decomposition result for more general valued fields. Those techniques were soon generalized to work with power series, p-adic subanalytic sets as well as developing a more powerful motivic integration. Its application allowed to solve a number of outstanding open problems in number theory.

In 2011, Aschenbrenner, Dolich, Haskell, Macpherson, Starchenko studied a notion of VC-density, asymptotic notion of finite growth behavior of definable sets in NIP setting, closely related to VC-dimension. Similar to dp-rank, introduced by Shelah in 1971, this notion allows to put a geometric measure on abstract definable sets. VC-density was estimated for a wide variety of structures, including p-adic numbers.

My goal is to find the estimates of VC-density for p-adics and other valued structures. Model theory allows a flexibility when choosing the formal language with which to describe p-adic numbers. Standard language is that of abstract fields. Studying reducts of that language allows to concentrate on qualitatively important parts of the structure circumventing the full complexity of p-adic numbers. I study VC-density in various p-adic reducts from [Leenknegt, 2013].

A common language for valued fields is Denef-Pas language, designating different sorts for value group and residue field. Another one is the language of RV-sorts introduced by Flenner in 2011. I investigate behavior of VC-density in both languages aiming to achieve results similar to Ax-Kochen relating VC-density of the field to VC-densities of its value group and residue field.

Along parallel lines, I analyze VC-density for a variety of graph structures. Shelah-Spencer graphs are random graphs studied by [Baldwin-Shi ’96], [Baldwin-Shelah ’97], [Laskowski ’06]. I estimate VC-density balance in terms of edge density of formulas. I also look at flat graphs, first studied by Podewski-Ziegler in 1978. Those are known to be well behaved model theoretically, I adapt existing techniques to analyze VC-density of specific families of flat graphs.
