P-adic numbers is a simple, yet very deep construction. It was only discovered a hundred years ago, but it could've been studied in classical mathematics when number theory was just forming. The construction is simple enough to explain at undergraduate level, yet has very deep and complex number theoretic structure. Normally the way real numbers are constructed are by allowing infinite decimal sequences. Letting decimals being infinite to the left instead of to the right yields a field as well, but with a drastically different behavior, now depending on the base in which the decimals were written. When base is a prime number P, this constructs p-adic numbers. Those were first studied for number theoretic purposes, but later found application outside of math in physics and computer science. My research would allow to get a better understanding of finite structure of sets defined by polynomials in p-adic numbers. In my career as an educator I hope to increase exposure to this beautiful construction for students inside and outside math department.

Model theory is a branch of formal logic. It was started by Godel in 1930, and with first major applications by Robinson in 1948 toward Hilbert's 10th problem. Model theory studies sets definable by first order formulas in a variety of mathematical objects. Restricting to subsets definable by simple formulas gives access to an array of powerful techniques such as indiscernible sequences and nonstandard extensions. Those allow insights not otherwise accessible by standard methods. One example is studying nonstandard real numbers, formalizing notions of infinitesimals. Model theory is an extremely flexible field with applications in many areas of mathematics, including algebra, analysis, geometry, number theory, computer science and combinatorics. Recent work by Zilber shows applications of model theory to quantum mechanics. In my career as a mathematician I hope to expose researchers in other fields to model theoretic methods to explore alternative approaches to classical mathematical object.

My research concentrates on the concept off VC density, a recent notion of rank in NIP theories. Study of a structure in model theory usually starts with quantifier elimination, followed by a finer analysis of definable functions and interpretability. Study of VC density is one step further, looking at structure of asymptotic growth of finite definable families. In the most geometric examples, VC density coincides with the natural notion of dimension. However, no geometric structure is required for definition of VC density, thus we can get some notion of geometric dimension for families of sets without any geometric context! In my career as a researcher I hope to further explore this notion and introduce other model theorists to it.
