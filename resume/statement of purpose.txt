I am a fifth-year graduate student at UCLA studying model theory with Pr. Matthias Aschenbrenner. My research concentrates on NIP theories,  p-adic numbers, and VC-density. This conference is a great opportunity for me to get exposed to the latest results in tame geometry. My next year will be the last year before graduation, so the conference will allow me to share my existing work, and get advice on application of my results before I start putting together my dissertation.
