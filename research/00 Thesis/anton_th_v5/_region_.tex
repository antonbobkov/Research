            \abstract       {
  Aschenbrenner et. al. have studied Vapnik-Chervonenkis density (VC-density) in the model-theoretic context.
  We investigate it further by computing it in some common structures: trees, Shelah-Spencer graphs, and an additive reduct
  of the field of $p$-adic numbers.
  In the theory of infinite trees we establish an optimal bound on the VC-density function.
  This generalizes a result of Simon showing that trees are dp-minimal. 
  In Shelah-Spencer graphs we provide an upper bound on a formula-by-formula basis and show that there isn't a uniform lower bound,
  forcing the VC-density function to be infinite.
  In addition we show that Shelah-Spencer graphs do not have a finite dp-rank,
  so they are not dp-minimal.
  There is a linear bound for the VC-density function in the field of $p$-adic numbers,
  but this bound is not known to be optimal.
  We investigate a certain $P$-minimal additive reduct of the field of $p$-adic numbers and
  use a cell decomposition result of Leenknegt to compute an optimal bound for that structure.
  Finally, following the results of Podewski and Ziegler we show that flat graphs are dp-minimal.
