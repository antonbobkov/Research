	We show that the theory of superflat graphs is dp-minimal.

We work with an infinite graph $G$ and a subset of vertices $V \subset V(G)$. Say that $V$ is $n$-connected if there aren't . Connectivity of $a,b$ is the smallest $n$ such that $a,b$ are $n$-connectivity

\begin{Lemma}
	Suppose $a,b$ in $G$ have finite connectivity $n+1$. Then there are finitely many $n$-point sets that disconnect $a$ from $b$.
\end{Lemma}

From now on work in a flat graph. It is stable so all the indiscernible sequences are totally indiscernible.

Suppose we have an indiscernible sequence over parameter set $A$ in a flat graph $(a_i)_{i \in I}$ with $I$ countable. Fix $n$. By a flatness result we can find an infinite $J \subset I$ and a finite set $B'$ such that each pair from $(a_j)_{j \in J}$ have infinite distance over $B'$. Using total indispensability we have an automorphism sending $(a_j)_{j \in J}$ to $(a_i)_{i \in I}$. Denote image of $B'$ under this automorphism as $B$.
