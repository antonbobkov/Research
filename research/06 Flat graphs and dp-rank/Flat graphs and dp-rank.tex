\section{Preliminaries}

Superflat graphs in model theoretic context were first introduced in \cite{stable_graphs} as a natural class of stable graphs. In this paper we further explore model theoretic structure of such graphs by directly showing that they are dp-minimal.

First, we introduce some basic definition regarding connectivity in graphs.
\begin{Definition}
	Work in an infinite graph $G$. Let $A, V \subset V(G)$
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Then for $a,b \in V(G)$ define $d_A(a,b)$ to be the \emph{distance} (length of the smallest path) in an induced subgraph of $G$ after removing vertices $A$.
		\item We say that $A$ \emph{separates} $V$ if for all $a,b \in V$, $d_A(a,b) = \infty$.
		\item We say that $V$ has \emph{connectivity} $n$ if there are no sets of size $n-1$ in $V(G)$ that separates $V$.
		\item Suppose $V$ has finite connectivity $n$. \emph{Connectivity hull} of $V$ is defined to be the union of all sets separating $V$ of size $n-1$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{Definition}

Connectivity of graphs is well described by Megner's Theorem. Here is a simple modification of the result in \cite{infinite_megner} concerning infinite graphs.

\begin{Theorem}
	Let $V$ be a subset of a graph $G$ with connectivity $n$. Then there exists a set of $n$ disjoint paths from $V$ into itself.
\end{Theorem}

\begin{Corollary}
	With assumptions as above, connectivity hull of $V$ is finite.
\end{Corollary}

\begin{proof}
	All the separating sets have to have exactly one vertex in each of those paths. 
\end{proof}

\section{Application to indiscernible sequences}

In this section we work in a superflat graph. It is stable so all the indiscernible sequences are totally indiscernible. Also note that by indiscernibility all pairwise distances between points are the same.

Denote by $K^m_n$ an $m$-subdivision of the complete graph on $n$ vertices. Graph is called superflat if for every $m \in \N$ there is $n \in \N$ such that the graph avoids $K^m_n$ as a subgraph. We have the following useful equivalent characterization as given in \cite{stable_graphs}, Theorem 2

\begin{Theorem}
	The following are equivalent
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $G$ is superflat
		\item For every $n \in \N$ and an infinite set $A \subset V(G)$, there exists a finite $B \subset V(G)$ and infinite $A' \subseteq A$ such that for all $x,y \in A'$ we have $d_{B}(x, y) > n$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{Theorem}

If the graph is superflat then, roughly, the intuition is that from every infinite set we can extract a sparse infinite subset (after throwing away finitely many nodes).

We will need a refined notion of connectivity for the following argument to work. Suppose we have two points $a,b$ distance $n$ apart. Denote $P(a,b)$ union of all paths of length $n$ going from $a$ to $b$. If we have a collection of vertices $V$ such that every two have distance $n$ between them, denote

Let $V \subset V(G)$. Denote $P_n(V)$ a union of all paths of length $\leq n$ between points of $V$. It is a subgraph of $G$.

\begin{align*}
	P_n(V) = \bigcup_{a \neq b \in V} P_n(a,b)
\end{align*}

\begin{Lemma}
	Let $(a_i)_{i \in I}$ be a countable indiscernible sequence over $A$. Fix $n \in \N$. There exists a finite set $B$ such that
	\begin{align*}
		\forall i \neq j \ d_B(a_i, a_j) > n
	\end{align*}
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof}
	By a flatness result we can find an infinite $J \subset I$ and a finite set $B'$ such that each pair from $(a_j)_{j \in J}$ have distance $>n$ over $B'$. Using total indiscernibility we have an automorphism sending $(a_j)_{j \in J}$ to $(a_i)_{i \in I}$. Image of $B'$ under this automorphism is the required set $B$.
\end{proof}

In other words, $B$ disconnects $P_n(\{a_i\})$. This shows that $\{a_i\}$ has finite connectivity in $P(\{a_i\})$. Applying lemma from last section we obtain that connectivity hull of $\{a_i\}$ in $P_n(\{a_i\})$ is finite.

\begin{Lemma}
	Connectivity hull of $\{a_i\}$ in $P_n(\{a_i\})$ is $\{a_i\}$-definable as a subset of $G$.
\end{Lemma}

\begin{Definition}
	Given a graph $G$ and $V \subset V(G)$ define $H(G, V)$ to be connectivity hull of $V$ in $G$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Note}
	Given a finite $V$ we have $H(P_n(V), V)$ is definable.
\end{Note}

\begin{proof}
	Consider finite parts of the sequence $I_i = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_i\}$. We study $H_i = H(P_n(I_i), I_i)$ as a function of $i$ as approximations of the hull in question. We have the following properties
	\begin{align*}
		 \forall i \ H(P_n(I_i), I_i) &\subseteq H(P_n(I), I_i) \\
		 \forall i \leq j \ H(P_n(I), I_i) &\supseteq H(P_n(I), I_j)
	\end{align*}
		Eventually $H(P_n(I_i))$ contains $n$ disjoint paths for the whole graph, thus stabilizes at $H(P_n(I), I)$. This shows that for large enough $i>N$ we have $H_i = H_{i+m}$. By symmetry of indiscernible sequence we have that any subset of size $N$ defines the connectivity hull.
\end{proof}

\begin{Lemma}
	$I$ is indiscernible over the $A \cup H(P_n(I), I)$.
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Denote the hull by $H$. Fix an $A$-formula $\phi(x,y)$. Consider a collection of traces $\phi(\vec a, H^\{|y|\})$ for $\vec a \in I^{|x|}$. As $H$ is $I$ definable those are either all distinct or all the same. Finiteness of $H$ forces latter. This shows indiscernability.
\end{proof}

\begin{Corollary}
	Let $(a_i)_{i \in I}$ be a countable indiscernible sequence over $A$. Then there is a countable $B$ such that  $(a_i)$ is indiscernible over $A \cup B$ and
	\begin{align*}
		\forall i \neq j \ d_B(a_i, a_j) = \infty
	\end{align*}
\end{Corollary}

\begin{proof}
	Let $B_i = H(P_i(I), I)$. Successive applications of previous lemma yield the appropriate set $B = \bigcup B_i$.
\end{proof}

That is every indiscernible sequence can be upgraded to have infinite distance over its parameter set.

\section{Superflat graphs are dp-minimal}

\begin{Lemma}
	Suppose $x \equiv_A y$ and $d_A(x, c) = d_A(y, c) = \infty$. Then $x \equiv_{Ac} y$
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Define an equivalence relation $G - A$. Two points $p, q$ are equivalent if $d_A(p,q)$ is finite. There is an automorphism $f$ of $G$ fixing $A$ sending $x$ to $y$. Denote by $X$ and $Y$ equivalence classes of $x$ and $y$ respectively. It's easy to see that $f(X) = Y$. Define the following function
	\begin{align*}
		&g = f \text { on } X \\
		&g = f^{-1} \text { on } Y \\
		&\text{identity otherwise}
	\end{align*}
	It is easy to see that $g$ is an automorphism fixing $Ac$ that sends $x$ to $y$.
\end{proof}

\begin{Theorem}
	Let $G$ be a flat graph with $(a_i)_{i\in\Q}$ indiscernible over $A$ and $b \in G$. There exists $c \in \Q$ such that all $(a_i)_{i\in\{\Q - c\}}$ have the same type over $Ab$.
\end{Theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Find $B \supseteq A$ such that $(a_i)$ is indiscernible over $B$ and has infinite distance over $B$. All the elements of the indiscernible sequence fall into distinct equivalence classes. $b$ can be in at most one of them. Exclude that element from the sequence. Remaining sequence elements are all infinitely far away from $b$. By previous lemma we have that elements of indiscernible sequence all have the same type over $Bb$.
\end{proof}

But this is exactly what it means to be dp-minimal, as given, say, in \cite{simon_dp_minimal} Lemma 1.4.4

\begin{Corollary}
	Flat graphs are dp-minimal.
\end{Corollary}
