\begin{abstract}
	We show that the theory of superflat graphs is dp-minimal.

Work with a labeled graph $(G, a, b)$. We call it $n$-connected if there isn't a set of $n-1$ vertices not including $a,b$ which removal disconnects $a$ from $b$. Connectivity of a graph is the largest $n$ such that the graph is $n$-connected.

\begin{Lemma}
	Suppose $(G, a, b)$ has finite connectivity $n+1$. Then there are finitely many $n$-point sets that disconnect $a$ from $b$.
\end{Lemma}

Suppose we have an indiscernable sequence over parameter set $A$ in a flat graph $(a_i)_{i \in I}$. Fix $n$. By flatness result we can find an infinite $J \subset I$ and a finite set $B'$ such that $(a_j)_{j \in J}$ have infinite distance over $B'$. By indiscernability we have an automorphism sending $(a_j)_{j \in J}$ to $(a_i)_{i \in I}$.
