Recall that a graph is called $n$-connected if there isn't a set of $n-1$ vertices which removal disconnects the graph. Connectivity of a graph is the largest $n$ such that the graph is $n$-connected.

\begin{Lemma}
	Fix two vertices $a,b$ in an infinite graph $G$. Suppose the distance between them is finite and equal to $n$. 
\end{Lemma}
