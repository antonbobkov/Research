We work with an infinite graph $G$ and a subset of vertices $V \subset V(G)$. Say that $V$ is $n$-connected if there aren't a set of $n-1$ vertices removing which disconnects every pair of vertices in $V$. Connectivity of $V$ is the smallest $n$ such that $V$ are $n$-connected.

\begin{Lemma}
	Suppose $\{a,b\}$ in $G$ have finite connectivity $n+1$. Then there are finitely many $n$-point sets that disconnect $a$ from $b$.
\end{Lemma}

\begin{Corollary}
	Suppose a finite $V \subset V(G)$ has finite connectivity $n+1$. Then there are finitely many $n$-point sets that disconnect $V$.
\end{Corollary}

\begin{Definition}
	Suppose $V \subset V(G)$ has finite connectivity $n+1$. Let connectivity hull of $V$ to be union of all $n$-point sets that disconnect it.
\end{Definition}

From now on work in a flat graph. It is stable so all the indiscernible sequences are totally indiscernible.

\begin{Lemma}
	Suppose we have an indiscernible sequence over parameter set $A$ in a flat graph $(a_i)_{i \in I}$ with $I$ countable. Then $(a_i)$
\end{Lemma}

Suppose we have an indiscernible sequence over parameter set $A$ in a flat graph $(a_i)_{i \in I}$ with $I$ countable. Fix $n$. By a flatness result we can find an infinite $J \subset I$ and a finite set $B'$ such that each pair from $(a_j)_{j \in J}$ have infinite distance over $B'$. Using total 
indispensability we have an automorphism sending $(a_j)_{j \in J}$ to $(a_i)_{i \in I}$. Denote image of $B'$ under this automorphism as $B$.

\begin{Theorem}
	Suppose we have an indiscernible sequence over parameter set $A$ in a flat graph $(a_i)_{i \in I}$ with $I$ countable. Fix $n \in \N$. Then there exists a finite set $B$ such that $(a_i)$ is indiscernible over $A \cup B$ and $\forall i \neq j \ d_B(a_i, a_j) \geq n$.
\end{Theorem}
