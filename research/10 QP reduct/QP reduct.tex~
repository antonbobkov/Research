\title{VC-density in an additive reduct of $p$-adic numbers}
\author{Anton Bobkov}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
  Aschenbrenner et. al. computed a bound $\vc(n) \leq 2n - 1$ for the VC density function in the field of $p$-adic numbers,
  but it is not known to be optimal.
  I investigate a certain $P$-minimal additive reduct of the field of $p$-adic numbers and
  use a cell decomposition result of Leenknegt to compute an optimal bound $\vc(n) = n$ for that structure.
\end{abstract}


\maketitle

VC density was introduced into model theory in \cite{density} by Aschenbrenner, Dolich, Haskell, MacPherson, and Starchenko
as a natural notion of dimension for definable families of sets in NIP theories.
In a NIP theory $T$ we can define the vc-function

\begin{align*}
  \vc_T = \vc : \N \arr \N
\end{align*}

where $\vc(n)$ measures the worst-case complexity of families of definable sets in an $n$-dimensional space.
The simplest possible behavior is $\vc(n) = n$ for all $n$.
For $T = \Th(\Q_p)$, the paper \cite{density} computes an upper bound for this function to be $2n-1$, and it is not known whether it is optimal.
This same bound would hold in any reduct of the field of $p$-adic numbers, so one may expect that the simplified structure of the reduct would allow a better bound.
In \cite{reduct}, Leenknegt provides a cell decomposition result for a certain P-minimal additive reduct of the field $p$-adic numbers.
Using this result, in this paper we improve the bound for the VC function, showing that in Leenknegt's structure $\vc(n) = n$.

\section{VC-dimension and VC-density}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\begin{Definition}
  Throughout this section we work with a collection $\F$ of subsets of a set $X$.
  We call the pair $(X, \F)$ a \defn{set system}.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Given a subset $A$ of $X$, we define the set system $(A, A \cap \F)$
      where $A \cap \F = \curly{A \cap F}_{F\in \F}$.
  \item For $A \subset X$ we say that $\F$ \defn{shatters} $A$ if $A \cap \F = \PP(A)$.
  \end{itemize}    
\end{Definition}  

\begin{Definition}
  We say $(X, \F)$ has VC-dimension $n$ if the largest subset of $X$ shattered by $\F$ is of size $n$.
  If $\F$ shatters arbitrarily large subsets of $X$, we say that $(x, \F)$ has infinite VC-dimension.
  We denote the VC-dimension of $(X, \F)$ by $\VC(\F)$.
\end{Definition}  

\begin{Note}
  We may drop $X$ from the previous definition, as it VC-dimension doesn't depend on the base set and is determined by $(\bigcup \F, \F)$.
\end{Note}
This allows us to distinguish between well behaved set systems of finite VC-dimension which tend to have good combinatorial properties and
poorly behaved set systems with infinite VC dimension.

Another natural combinatorial notion is that of a dual system:
\begin{Definition}
  For $a \in X$ define $X_a = \curly{F \in \F \mid a \in F}$.
  Let $\F^* = \curly{X_a}_{a \in X}$.
  We define $(\F, \F^*)$ as the \defn{dual system} of $(X, \F)$.
  The VC-dimension of the dual system of $(X, \F)$ is referred to as the \defn{dual VC-dimension} of $(X, \F)$ and denoted by $\VC^*(\F)$.
  (As before, this notion doesn't depend on $X$.)
\end{Definition}  

\begin{Lemma}
  A set system has finite VC-dimension if and only if its dual system has finite VC-dimension.
  More precisely
  \begin{align*}
    \VC^*(\F) \leq 2^{1+\VC(\F)}.
  \end{align*}
\end{Lemma}

For a more refined notion we look at the traces of our family on finite sets:
\begin{Definition}
  Define the \defn{shatter function} $\pi_\F \colon \N \arr \N$ and the \defn{dual shatter function} $\pi^*_\F \colon \N \arr \N$ of $\F$ by 
  \begin{align*}
    \pi_\F(n) &= \max \curly{|A \cap \F| \mid A \subset X \text{ and } |A| = n} \\
    \pi^*_\F(n) &= \max \curly{\text{number of atoms in Boolean algebra generated by $B$} \mid B \subset \F, |B| = n}
  \end{align*}
  Note that the dual shatter function is precisely the shatter function of the dual system: $\pi^*_\F = \pi_{\F^*}$
\end{Definition}  

A simple upper bound is $\pi_\F(n) \leq 2^n$ (same for the dual).
If VC-dimension is infinite then clearly $\pi_\F(n) = 2^n$ for all $n$. Conversely we have the following remarkable fact:
\begin{Theorem} [Sauer-Shelah '72]
  If the set system $(X, \F)$ has finite VC-dimension $d$ then $\pi_\F(n) \leq {n \choose \leq d}$ where
  ${n \choose \leq d} = {n \choose d} + {n \choose d - 1} + \ldots + {n \choose 1}$.    
\end{Theorem}

Thus the systems with a finite VC-dimension are precisely the systems where the shatter function grows polynomially.
Define VC-density to be the degree of that polynomial:
\begin{Definition}
  Define \defn{vc-density} and \defn{dual vc-density} of $\F$ as
  \begin{align*}
	  \vc(\F) &= \limsup_{n \to \infty}\frac{\log \pi_\F(n)}{\log n} \in \R^{\geq 0} \cup \curly{+\infty}\\
	  \vc^*(\F) &= \limsup_{n \to \infty}\frac{\log \pi^*_\F(n)}{\log n}\in \R^{\geq 0} \cup \curly{+\infty}
  \end{align*}
\end{Definition}

Generally speaking a shatter function that is bounded by a polynomial doesn't itself have to be a polynomial.
Proposition 4.12 in \cite{density} gives an example of a shatter function that grows like $n \log n$ (so it has VC-density $1$).

So far the notions that we have defined are purely combinatorial.
We now adapt VC-dimension and VC-density to the model theoretic context.

\begin{Definition}
  Work in a structure $M$.
  Fix a finite collection of formulas $\Phi(x, y) = \curly{\phi_i(x, y)}$.

  \begin{itemize}
	  \item For $\phi(x, y) \in \LL(M)$ and $b \in M^{|y|}$ let $\phi(M^{|x|}, b) = \{a \in M^{|x|} \mid \phi(a, b)\} \subseteq M^{|x|}$.
  \item Let $\Phi(M^{|x|}, M^{|y|})= \{\phi_i(M^{|x|}, b) \mid \phi_i \in \Phi, b \in M^{|y|}\} \subseteq \PP(M^{|x|})$.
  \item Let $\F_\Phi = \Phi(M^{|x|}, M^{|y|})$ giving a set system $(M^{|x|}, \F_\Phi)$.
  \item Define \defn{VC-dimension} of $\Phi$, $\VC(\Phi)$ to be the dual VC-dimension of $(M^{|x|}, \F_\Phi)$.
  \item Define \defn{VC-density} of $\Phi$, $\vc(\Phi)$ to be the dual VC-density of $(M^{|x|}, \F_\Phi)$.
  \end{itemize}

  We will also refer to the VC-density and VC-dimension of a single formula $\phi$
  viewing it as a one element collection $\curly{\phi}$.
\end{Definition}

Counting atoms of a Boolean algebra in a model theoretic setting corresponds to counting types,
so it is instructive to rewrite the shatter function in terms of types.

\begin{Definition}
  \begin{align*}
    \pi_\Phi(n) &= \max \curly{\text{number of $\Phi$-types over $B$} \mid B \subset M, |B| = n} \\
	  \vc(\Phi) &= \text{degree of polynomial growth of $\pi_\Phi(n)$}  = \limsup_{n \to \infty}\frac{\log \pi_\Phi(n)}{\log n}
  \end{align*}
\end{Definition}  

One can check that the shatter function and hence VC-dimension and VC-density of a formula are elementary notions,
so they only depend on the first-order theory of the structure.

NIP theories are a natural context for studying VC-density.
In fact we can take the following as the definition of NIP:
\begin{Definition}
  Define $\phi$ to be NIP if it has finite VC-dimension. 
\end{Definition}

\cite{Aschenbrenner_reference_8} shows that in a general combinatorial context,
VC-density can be any real number in $0 \cup [1, \infty)$.
Less is known if we restrict our attention to NIP theories.
Proposition 4.6 in \cite{density} gives examples of formulas that have non-integer rational VC-density in an NIP theory,
however it is open whether one can get an irrational VC-density in this context.

In general, instead of working with a theory formula by formula, we can look for a uniform bound for all formulas:
\begin{Definition}
  For a given NIP structure $M$, define the \defn{vc-function}
  \begin{align*}
    \vc^M(n) = \sup \{\vc(\phi(x, y)) \mid \phi \in \LL(M), |x| = n\}
  \end{align*}
\end{Definition}

As before this definition is elementary, so it only depends on the theory of $M$.
We omit the superscript $M$ if it is understood from the context.
One can easily check the following bounds:
\begin{Lemma} [Lemma 3.22 in \cite{density}]
  \begin{align*}
    \vc(1) &\geq 1 \\
    \vc(n) &\geq n\vc(1)
  \end{align*}  
\end{Lemma}

However, it is not known whether the second inequality can be strict or even whether $\vc(1) < \infty$ implies $\vc(n) < \infty$.

\section{$P$-adic numbers}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The field of $p$-adic numbers is often studied in the language of Macintyre $\LLM = \curly{0, 1, +, -, \cdot, |, P_n}$.
which is a language of fields together with unary predicates $\curly{P_n}_{n \in \N} $ interpreted in $\Q_p$ by

\begin{align*}
  P_n x \leftrightarrow \exists y \; y^n = x
\end{align*}

and a divisibility relation where $a|b$ holds when $\vval a \leq \vval b$.

Note that $P_n\backslash \curly{0}$ is a multiplicative subgroup of $\Q_p$ with finitely many cosets.

\begin{Theorem} [Macintyre '76]
  The $\LLM$-structure $\Q_p$ has quantifier elimination.
\end{Theorem}

There is also a cell decomposition result.
\begin{Definition}
  Define \defn{$n$-cell} recursively.
  $0$-cells are points in $\Q_p$.
  An $n+1$-cell is a subset of $\Q_p^{n+1}$ of the following form:
  \begin{align*}
    \curly{(x, t) \in \Q_p \times D \mid \vval a_1(x) \ \square_1 \vval (t - c(x)) \ \square_2 \vval a_2(x), t - c(x) \in \lambda P_n}
  \end{align*}
  where $D$ is an $n$-cell,
  $a_1(x), a_2(x), c(x)$ are $\emptyset$-definable,
  $\square$ is $<, \leq$ or no condition, and
  $\lambda \in \Q_p$.    
\end{Definition}

\begin{Theorem} [Denef '84]
  Any subset of $\Q_p$ defined by a $\LLM$-formula $\phi(x, t)$ with $|t| = 1$ and $|x| = n$ decomposes into a finite union of $n+1$-cells.
\end{Theorem}  

In \cite{density}, Aschenbrenner, Dolich, Haskell, Macpherson, and Starchenko show that this structure has $\vc(n) \leq 2n - 1$,
however it is not known whether this bound is optimal.

In \cite{reduct}, Leenknegt analyzes the reduct of $p$-adic numbers to the language
\begin{align*}
  \LL_{aff}  = \curly{0, 1, +, -, \curly{\bar c}_{c \in \Q_p}, |, \curly{Q_{m,n}}_{m,n\in \N}}
\end{align*}
where $\bar c$ is a scalar multiplication by $c$,
$a | b$ stands for $\vval a \leq \vval b$,
and $Q_{m,n}$ is a unary predicate
\begin{align*}
  Q_{m,n} = \bigcup_{k \in \Z} p^{km} (1 + p^n\Z_p).
\end{align*}
Note that $Q_{m,n}$ is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of $\Q_p$ with finitely many cosets.
One can check that the extra relation symbols are definable in the $\LLM$-structure $\Q_p$.
The paper \cite{reduct} provides a cell decomposition result with the following cells:

\begin{Definition}
  A $0$-cell is a point in $\Q_p$.
  An $n+1$-cell is a subset of $\Q_p^{n+1}$ of the following form:
  \begin{align*}
    \curly{(x, t) \in K \times D \mid \vval a_1(x) \ \square_1 \vval (t - c(x)) \ \square_2 \vval a_2(x), t - c(x) \in \lambda Q_{m,n} }
  \end{align*}
  where $D$ is an $n$-cell called the \defn{base} of the cell,
  $a_1(x), a_2(x), c(x)$ are linear polynomials,
  $\square$ is $<$ or no condition, and
  $\lambda  \in\Q_p$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Theorem}[Leenknegt '12] 
  Any formula $\phi(x, t)$ in $(\Q_p, \LL_{aff})$ with $|t| = 1$ and $|x| = n$ decomposes into a union of $n+1$-cells.
\end{Theorem}  

Moreover, \cite{reduct} shows that $(\Q_p, \LL_{aff})$ is a $P$-minimal reduct,
that is the one-dimensional definable sets of $(\Q_p, \LL_{aff})$ coincide with the one-dimensional definable sets in the full structure $(\Q_p, \LLM)$.

I am able to compute the $\vc$-function for this structure
\begin{Theorem} {Theorem (B.)}
  $(\Q_p, \LL_{aff})$ has $\vc(n) = n$.
\end{Theorem}

\section{Key Lemmas and Definitions}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Quantifier elimination result can be easily obtained from cell decomposition:
\begin{Lemma}
  Any formula $\phi(x; y)$ in $(\Q_p, \LL_{aff})$ can be written as a boolean combination of formulas from the following collection
  \begin{align*}
    \Psi(x; y) = &\curly{\vval (p_i(x) - c_i(y)) < \vval (p_j(x) - c_j(y))}_{i, j \in I} \cup \\
    &\curly{p_i(x) - c_i(y) \in \lambda_k Q_{m,n}}_{i \in I , k \in K}
  \end{align*}
  where $I, K$ are finite index sets,
  each $p_i$ is a linear polynomial in $x$ without a constant term,
  each $c_i$ is a linear polynomial in $y$, and
  $\lambda_k \in \Q_p$.
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $l = |x| + |y|$.
  Apply cell decomposition theorem to $\phi(x; y)$ to obtain $\DD^l$, a collection of $l$-cells.
  Let $\DD^{l-1}$ be a collection $l-1$ of bases of cells in $\DD^l$.
  Similarly, construct by induction $\DD^i$ for each $0 \leq j < l$,
  where $\DD_j$ is a collection of $j$-cells which are the bases of cells in $\DD_{j+1}$.
  Let $\DD = \bigcup \DD_j$.
  Choose $n,m$ large enough to cover all $n', m'$ that come up in the cells for $Q_{n',m'}$.
  Choose $\lambda_k$ to go over all the cosets of $Q_{n,m}$.
  Let $q_i(x, y)$ enumerate all of the polynomials $a_1(\bar x), a_2(\bar x), t - c(\bar x)$ that show up in the cells of $\DD$.
  Those are all polynomials of degree $\leq 1$ in variables $x, y$.
  We can split each of them as $q_i(x,y) = p_i(x) - c_j(y)$ where the constant term goes into $c_j$.
  This gives us the appropriate finite collection of formulas $\Psi$.
  From cell decomposition it is easy to see that when $a, a'$ have the same $\Psi$-type,
  then they would have they have the same $\phi$-type.
  Thus $\phi$ can be written as a boolean combination of formulas from $\Psi$.
\end{proof}

\begin{Lemma}
  If $\phi$ can be written as a Boolean combination of formulas from $\Psi$ then
  \begin{align*}
    \vc (\Psi) \leq n \implies \vc (\phi) \leq n
  \end{align*}
\end{Lemma}

If $a,a'$ have the same $\Psi$-type over $B$, then they have the same $\phi$-type over $B$, where $B$ is some parameter set.
Therefore the number of $\phi$-types is bounded by the number of $\Psi$-types.
The bound follows from lemma \ref{??}

Therefore to show that $$

\begin{Definition}
  A tuple $p \in  \Q_p^{|x|}$ can be viewed as a vector $\vec p$, treating $\Q_p^{|x|}$ as a vector space over $\Q_p$.
\end{Definition}

We may rewrite our collection of formulas $\Psi(x, y)$ as

\begin{align*}
  &\val (\vec p_i \cdot \vec x) - c_i(y) < \val (\vec p_j \cdot \vec x) - c_j(y) & i, j \in I \\
  &\val (\vec p_i \cdot \vec x) - c_i(y) \in \lambda_k Q & i \in I , k \in K
\end{align*}

\begin{Lemma}	 \label{gamma}
  Suppose we have a finite collection of vectors $\curly{\vec p_i}_{i \in I}$ with each $\vec p_i \in \Q_p^{|x|}$.
  Suppose $J \subset I$ and $i \in I$ satisfy
  \begin{align*}
    \vec p_i \in \vecspan \curly{\vec p_j}_{j \in J}, 
  \end{align*}
  and we have $\vec x \in \Q_p^{|x|}, \alpha \in \Z$ with
  \begin{align*}
    \val(\vec p_j \cdot \vec x) > \alpha \text{ for all } j \in J
  \end{align*}
  Then
  \begin{align*}
    \val(\vec p_i \cdot \vec x) > \alpha - \gamma
  \end{align*}
  for some $\gamma \in \N$.
  Moreover $\gamma$ can be chosen independently from $J, j, \vec x, \alpha$ depending only on $\curly{\vec p_i}_{i \in I}$.
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Fix $i, J$ satisfying the conditions of the lemma.
  For some $c_j \in \Q_p$ for $j \in J$ we have
  \begin{align*}
    \vec p_i &= \sum_{j \in J} c_j \vec p_j,
  \end{align*}
  hence
  \begin{align*}
    \vec p_i \cdot \vec x &= \sum_{j \in J} c_j \vec p_j \cdot \vec x.
  \end{align*}
  We have
  \begin{align*}
    \val \paren{c_j \vec p_j \cdot \vec x} = \val \paren{c_j} + \val \paren{\vec p_j \cdot \vec x} > \val \paren{c_j} + \alpha.
  \end{align*}
  %Pick $\gamma = -\max \val \paren{c_i}$ or $0$ if all those values are positive.
  Let $\gamma = \max(0, \min -\val \paren{c_j})$.
  Then we have 
  \begin{align*}
    &\val \paren{c_j \vec p_j \cdot \vec x} > \alpha - \gamma &\text{ for all $j \in J$}\\
    &\sum_{j \in J} c_j \vec p_j \cdot \vec x > \alpha - \gamma
  \end{align*}
  This shows that we can pick such $\gamma$ for a given choice of $i, J$, but independent from $\alpha, \vec x$.
  To get a choice independent from $i, J$, go over all such eligible choices 
  ($i$ ranges over $I$ and $J$ ranges over subsets of $I$),
  pick $\gamma$ for each, and then take the maximum of those values.
\end{proof}

\begin{Definition}
  For $c \in \Q_p, \alpha \in \Z$ we define an open ball 
  \begin{align*}
    B(c, \alpha) = \curly{c' \in \Q_p \mid \val \paren{c' - c} \leq \alpha}
  \end{align*}
\end{Definition}

\begin{Definition}
  Suppose we have a finite $T \subset \Q_p$.
  We view it as a tree as follows.
  Branches through the tree are elements of $T$.
  With this tree we associate open balls $B(t_1, \val(t_1 - t_2))$ for all $t_1, t_2 \in T$.
  An interval is two balls $B(t_1, v_1) \supset B(t_2, v_2)$ with no balls in between.
  An element $a \in \Q_p$ belongs to this interval if $a \in B(t_1, v_1) \backslash B(t_2, v_2)$.
  There are at most $2|T|$ different intervals and they partition the entire space.
  
  Fix a parameter set $B$ of size $N$.
  
  Consider a tree $T = \curly{c_i(b) \mid b \in B, i \in I}$
  It has at most $O(N) = N \cdot |I|$ many intervals.
  Denote the set of all intervals as $\Pt$.
  For the remainder of the paper we work with this tree.	
\end{Definition}

\begin{Definition}
  Let $c \in \Q_p$.
  It lies in the tree in one of the unique intervals $B(c_L, \alpha_L) \backslash B(c_U, \alpha_U)$.
  Define $F(c)$, the floor of $c$ to be $\alpha_L$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Definition}
  We say $x, x' \in \Q_p$ have the same tree type if
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\val(x - c_i(b)) < \val(x - c_j(b))$ iff $\val(x' - c_i(b)) < \val(x' - c_j(b))$ for all $i,j \in I, b \in B$
  \item $x + c_i(b)$ is in the same $Q$-coset as $x' + c_i(b)$ for all $i \in I, b \in B$
  \end{itemize}
\end{Definition}

\begin{Lemma} \label{sigh}
  Let $a, a' \in \Q_p^{|x|}$.
  If $p_i(a), p_i(a')$ have the same tree type for all $i \in I$, then $a, a'$ have the same $\Psi$-type.
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Clear from the construction.
\end{proof}

\begin{Definition}
  For $c \in \Q_p$ and $\alpha, \beta \in \Z$ let $c \midr [\alpha, \beta] \in \paren{\Z/p\Z}^{\beta - \alpha}$ be the record of coefficients of $c$ for the valuations between $\alpha, \beta$.
  More precisely write $c$ in its power series form
  \begin{align*}
    c = \sum_{\gamma \in Z} c_\gamma p^\gamma \text{ with } c_\gamma \in \Z/p\Z
  \end{align*}
  Then $c \midr [\alpha, \beta]$ is just $(c_\alpha, c_{\alpha+1}, \ldots c_\beta)$.
\end{Definition}

The following lemma is an adaptation of lemma 7.4 in \cite{density}.

\begin{Lemma} \label{distance}
  For $n,m$ there exists $D = D(n,m) \in \Z$ such that for any $x,y,a \in \Q_p$ if
  \begin{align*}
    \val (x - c) = \val (y - c) < \val (x - y) - D
  \end{align*}
  then $x - c, y - c$ are in the same coset of $Q_{n,m}$.
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Define that $a,b \in \Q_p$ are similar if $\val a = \val b$ and
  \begin{align*}
    a \midr [\val a, \val a + (m + n)] = b \midr [\val b, \val b + (m + n)]
  \end{align*}
  If $a,b$ are similar then
  \begin{align*}
    a \in Q_{n,m} \leftrightarrow b \in Q_{n,m}
  \end{align*}
  Moreover for any $\lambda \in \Q_p$, if $a,b$ are similar we would also have $a/\lambda, b/\lambda$ are similar.
  Thus if $a,b$ are similar, then they belong in the same coset of $Q_{n,m}$.
  If we pick $D = n + m$ then conditions of the lemma force $x - c, y - c$ to be similar.
\end{proof} 

The following construction is along the lines of lemmas 7.3, 7.5 of \cite{density}.

\begin{Definition}
  For two balls $B(a, \alpha), B(b, \beta)$ let $\gamma = \min(\alpha, \beta, \val(a - b))$.
  Define the distance between those two balls to be $|\alpha - \gamma| + |\beta - \gamma|$.
  In $\Q_p$ value group is discrete and residue field is finite, so there are finitely many balls at a fixed distance from a given ball.
  Near balls of $B(a, \alpha)$ are defined to be balls with distance $\D$ from $B(a, \alpha)$.
  Enumerate those as:
  \begin{align*}
    B_1(a, \alpha), B_2(c, \alpha), \ldots B_{N_D}(a, \alpha)
  \end{align*}
  Near balls partition the space
  \begin{align*}
    \curly{b \in \Q_p \mid |\val(a - b) - \alpha| \leq D}
  \end{align*}
\end{Definition}

\begin{Definition}
  Let $c \in \Q_p$.
  It lies in our tree in one of the intervals $B(c_L, \alpha_L) \backslash B(c_U, \alpha_U)$.
  Suppose $c$ lies in one of the near balls of $B(c_L, \alpha_L)$ or $B(c_U, \alpha_U)$.
  Then define its interval type to be the index of that near ball.
  Otherwise define its interval type to be the coset of $c - c_U$ of $Q$.
  Denote the space of all the possible branch types $\Bt$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Lemma} \label{interval}
  If $a, a'$ are in the same interval and have the same interval type then they have the same tree type.
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof}
  First part of the tree type definition is satisfied as $a, a'$ are in the same interval,
  so we only need to demonstrate that the corresponding $Q$-cosets match.
  Pick any element of our tree $c_i(b)$.
  We want to show that $a - c_i(b), a' - c_i(b)$ are in the same $Q$-coset.
  
  Suppose $a$ is in one of the near balls.
  As $a'$ has the same interval type, it has to be in the same near ball.
  By definition of the near ball we then have $\val(a - c_i(b)) = \val(a' - c_i(b)) < \val(a - a') - D$.
  Thus by Lemma \ref{distance} we have $a - c_i(b), a' - c_i(b)$ in the same $Q$-coset.
  
  Now, suppose both $a, a'$ aren't in any near balls.
  Label their interval as $B(c_L, \alpha_L) \backslash B(c_U, \alpha_U)$.
  Then we have 
  \begin{align*}
    \alpha_L + D < &\val (a - c_U) < \alpha_U - D \\
    \alpha_L + D < &\val (a' - c_U) < \alpha_U - D
  \end{align*}
  as otherwise one (both) of them would be in one of the near balls.
  We have either $\val(c_U - c_i(b)) \geq \alpha_U$ or $\val(c_U - c_i(b)) \leq \alpha_L$
  as otherwise it would contradict the definition of an interval.
  
  Suppose it is the first case $\val(c_U - c_i(b)) \geq \alpha_U$.
  Then
  \begin{align*}
    \val(a - c_i(b)) = \val(a - c_U) < \alpha_U - D \leq \val(c_U - c_i(b)) - D
  \end{align*}
  so by Lemma \ref{distance} we have $a - c_i(b), a - c_U$ are in the same $Q$-coset.
  By a parallel argument we have $a' - c_i(b), a' - c_U$ are in the same $Q$-coset.
  As we are assuming $a, a'$ have the same tree type it implies that $a - c_U, a' - c_U$ are in the same $Q$-coset.
  Thus by transitivity we get that $a - c_i(b), a' - c_i(b)$ are in the same $Q$-coset.
  
  For the second case, suppose $\val(c_U - c_i(b)) \leq \alpha_L$.
  Then
  \begin{align*}
    \val(a - c_i(b)) = \val(c_U - c_i(b)) \leq \alpha_L < \val(a - c_U) - D
  \end{align*}
  so by Lemma \ref{distance} we have $a - c_i(b), c_U - c_i(b)$ are in the same $Q$-coset.
  By a parallel argument we have $a' - c_i(b), c_U - c_i(b)$ are in the same $Q$-coset.
  Thus by transitivity we get that $a - c_i(b), a' - c_i(b)$ are in the same $Q$-coset.

\section{Main Proof}

Fix $\gamma$ corresponding to $\curly{\vec p_i}_{i \in I}$ according to Lemma \ref{gamma}.

\begin{Definition}
  Denote $\Z/p\Z^\gamma$ as $\Ct$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Definition}
  Let $f: \Q_p^{|x|} \arr \Q_p^I$ with $f(\bar c) = (p_i(\bar c))_{i \in I}$.
  Define the segment space $\Sg$ to be the image of $f$.	
\end{Definition}


Given a tuple $(a_i)_{i\in I}$in the segment space look at the corresponding floors $\curly{F(a_i)}_{i\in I}$.
Those are ordered as elements of $\Z$.
Partition the segment space by order type of $\{F(a_i)\}$.
Work in a fixed partition $\Sg'$.
After relabeling we may assume that
\begin{align*}
  F(a_1) \geq F(a_2) \geq \ldots 
\end{align*}

Consider the (relabeled) sequence of vectors $\vec p_1, \vec p_2, \ldots, \vec p_I$.
There is a unique subset $J \subset I$ such that all vectors with indices in $J$ are linearly independent, and all vectors with indices outside of $J$ are a linear combination of preceding vectors.
For any index $i \in I$ we call it independent if $i \in J$ and we call it dependent otherwise.
%Let $m = |J|$.

Now, we define the following function
\begin{align*}
  g: \Sg' \arr \Bt^I \times \Pt^J \times \Ct^{I - J}
\end{align*}

Let $\bar a = (a_i)_{i\in I} \in \Sg'$.
To define $g(\bar a)$ we need to specify where it maps $\bar a$ in each individual component of the product.

For all $a_i$ record its interval type $\in \Bt$, giving the first component.

For $a_j$ with $j \in J$, record the interval of $a_j$, giving the second component.

For the third component do the following computation.
Pick $a_i$ with $i$ dependent.
Let $j$ be the largest independent index with $j < i$.
Record $a_i \midr [F(a_j) - \gamma, F(a_j)]$.



\begin{Lemma}
  For $\bar a, \bar a' \in \Sg'$ if $g(\bar a) = g(\bar a')$ then $a_i, a_i'$ have the same tree type for all $i \in I$.	
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof}
  For each $i$ we show that $a_i, a_i'$ are in the same interval and have the same interval type, so the conclusion follows by Lemma \ref{interval}.
  $\Bt$ records the interval type of each element, so if $g(\bar a) = g(\bar a')$ then $a_i, a_i'$ have the same interval type for all $i \in I$.
  Thus it remains to show that $a_i, a_i'$ lie in the same interval for all $i \in I$.
  Suppose $i$ is an independent index.
  Then by construction, $\Pt$ records the interval for $a_i, a_i'$, so those have to belong to the same interval.
  Now suppose $i$ is dependent.
  Pick the largest $j < i$ such that $j$ is independent.
  We have $F(a_i) \leq F(a_j)$ and $F(a_i') \leq F(a_j')$.
  Moreover $F(a_j) = F(a_j')$ as they are mapped to the same interval (using the earlier part of the argument as $j$ is independent).
  
  \begin{Claim}
    $\val(a_i - a_i') > F(a_j) - \gamma$
  \end{Claim}
  \begin{proof}
    Let $\vec x, \vec x' \in \Q_p^{|x|}$ be some elements with
    \begin{align*}
      \vec p_k &\cdot \vec x = a_k \\
      \vec p_k &\cdot \vec x' = a_k' \text { for all } k \in I
    \end{align*}
    It is always possible to do that as $\bar a, \bar a' \in \Sg'$. 
    Let $J'$ be the set of the independent indices less than $i$.
    We have 
    \begin{align*}
      \val(a_k - a_k') > F(a_k) \text { for all } k \in J'
    \end{align*}
    as for the independent indices $a_k, a_k'$ lie in the same interval.
    \begin{align*}
      &\val(a_k - a_k') > F(a_j) \text { for all } k \in J' \text{ by monotonicity of $F(a_k)$} \\
      &\val(\vec p_k \cdot \vec x - \vec p_k \cdot \vec x') > F(a_j) \text { for all } k \in J' \\
      &\val(\vec p_k \cdot (\vec x - \vec x')) > F(a_j) \text { for all } k \in J' \\
    \end{align*}
    $J'$ and $i$ match the requirements of Lemma \ref {gamma} so we conclude
    \begin{align*}
      &\val(\vec p_i \cdot (\vec x - \vec x')) > F(a_j) - \gamma \\
      &\val(\vec p_i \cdot \vec x - \vec p_i \cdot \vec x') > F(a_j) - \gamma \\
      &\val(a_i - a_i')) > F(a_j) - \gamma
    \end{align*}
    as needed, finishing the proof of the claim.
  \end{proof}	
  Additionally $a_i, a_i'$ have the same image in $\Ct$ component, so we have
  \begin{align*}
    \val(a_i - a_i') > F(a_j) 
  \end{align*}
  As $F(a_i) \leq F(a_j)$, $a_i, a_i'$ have to lie in the same interval.	
\end{proof}

\begin{Corollary}
  $\Psi(x,y)$ has VC-density $\leq |x|$
\end{Corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose we have $c, c' \in \Q_p^{|x|}$ such that $f(c), f(c')$ are in the same partition and $g(f(c)) = g(f(c'))$.
  Then by the previous lemma $p_i(c)$ has the same tree type as $p_i(c')$ for all $i\in I$.
  Then by Lemma \ref{sigh} $c, c'$ have the same $\Psi$-type.
  Thus the number of possible $\Psi$-types is bounded by the size of the range of $g$ times the number of possible partitions
  
  \begin{align*}
    \text{(number of partitions)} \cdot |Bt|^{|I|} \cdot |Pt|^{|J|} \cdot |Ct|^{|I-J|}
  \end{align*}
  
  We have
  
  \begin{align*}
    |\Bt| = N_D + \text {number of cosets of $Q$}
    |\Pt| &\leq N \cdot I^2 \text { (the only component dependent on $N$)} \\
    |\Ct| &= p^\gamma 
  \end{align*}
  and there are at most ${|I|}!$ many partitions of $\Sg$. 
  This gives us a bound
  
  \begin{align*}
    {|I|}! \cdot |Bt|^{|I|} \cdot (N \cdot {|I|}^2)^{|J|} \cdot p^{\gamma {|I-J|}} = O(N^{|J|})
  \end{align*}	
  
  Every $p_i$ is an element of a $|x|$-dimensional vector space, so there can be at most $|x|$ many independent vectors.
  Thus we have $|J| \leq |x|$ and the bound follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{Corollary}
  In the language $\LLA$ we have $\vc(n) = n$.
\end{Corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Previous lemma implies that $\vc(\phi) \leq \vc(\Psi) \leq |x|$.
  As choice of $\phi$ was arbitrary, this implies that VC-density of any formula is bounded by the arity of $x$.
\end{proof}
