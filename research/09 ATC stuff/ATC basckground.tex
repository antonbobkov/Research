\section{VC-dimension}

Suppose we have an infinite collection of sets $\F$.
Take $n$ many of those sets.
They generate a boolean algebra.
Count the number of atoms in it.
There can be at most $2^n$ atoms, though depending on the collection there may be much less.
For a given $n$, out of all choices of $n$ sets, record the highest possible number of atoms generated.
We define that to be a shatter function.

\begin{Definition}
	\begin{align*}
		\pi_\F(n) = \max \curly{ \text {\# of atoms in boolean algebra generated by $S$} \mid S \subset \F \text{ and } |S| = n}
	\end{align*}
\end{Definition}
