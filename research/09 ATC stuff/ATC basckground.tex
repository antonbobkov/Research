Suppose we have a collection of sets $\F$.
Take $n$ many of those sets.
They generate a boolean algebra.
Count the number of atoms in it.
There can be at most $2^n$ atoms, though depending on the collection there may be much less.
For a given $n$, out of all choices of $n$ sets, record the highest possible number of atoms generated.
This is a shatter function.

	\pi_\F(n) = \max \curly{  }
