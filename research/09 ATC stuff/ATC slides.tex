\begin{frame}
	Suppose we have an infinite collection of sets $\F$.
	Take $n$ many of those sets.
	They generate a boolean algebra.
	Count the number of atoms in it.
	There can be at most $2^n$ atoms, though depending on the collection there may be much less.
	For a given $n$, out of all choices of $n$ sets, record the highest possible number of atoms generated.
	We define that to be a shatter function.
