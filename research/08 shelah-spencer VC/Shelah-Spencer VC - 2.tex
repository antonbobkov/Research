Fix a formula $\phi(x, y)$ that is a minimal chain extension $\curly{M_i}_{i \in [0..k]}$ with $M_0 = \{x, y\}$ with
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\phi(x, y)$ determines edges and non-edges on $\curly{x, y}$.
	\item there are no edges between $x$ and $y$.
	%\item there are no edges between $x$.
	\item Let $\dim \paren{M_i/M_{i-1}} = -\epsilon_i$.
	\item Let $\epsilon_L = \sum_{[1..k]} \epsilon_i$.
	\item Let $\epsilon_U = \min_{[1..k]} \epsilon_i$.
	\item Let $Y = \dim (y)$ considering $y$ as a graph.
	In particular if $\{y\}$ are disconnected then $Y = |y|$.
\end{itemize}

Some of our results only apply to a special family of parameter sets
\begin{align*}
	\AA = \curly{A \subset \U^{y} \mid \text{finite, disconnected, strongly embedded}}
\end{align*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Lower bound}

Let $n$ be the integer such that $n \epsilon_L < Y$ and $(n+1) \epsilon_L > Y$.

Consider the graph $x$.
If $x$ is not positive, then $\phi$ has no realizations.

Pick parameter set 

\begin{align*}
	A = \bigcup_{i<N} b_i
\end{align*}

a disjoint union where each $b_i$ is an ordered tuple of size $|x|$ connected according to $\phi$.

Pick a finite $B \subset A^{|x|}$.

Consider the graph $y$.
If $y$ is not positive, then $\phi$ has no realizations over $B$.
Otherwise, take an abstract realization of $y$, and label it by $b$.

Fix $n$ arbitrary elements of $B$, label them $a_i$, with each $|a_i| = |x|$.
Abstractly adjoin $M_i/\curly{a_i, b} = M/\curly{x,y}$ for each $i$.
Let $\bar M = \bigcup M_i$ (disjointly).

\begin{Claim}
	$(A \cap \bar M) \leq \bar M$.
\end{Claim}
\begin{proof}
	It's total dimension is $Y - n\epsilon_L > 0$ and all subextensions are positive as well.
\end{proof}

Thus a copy of $\bar M$ can be embedded over $A$ into our ambient model.
Choice of elements of $B$ was arbitrary, thus showing that any $n$ elements can be traced out.
Thus we have $O(|B|^n)$ many traces showing $\vc$-density of at least $n$.

\begin{align*}
	\vc_\AA(\phi) \geq \floor{\frac{Y}{\epsilon_L}}
\end{align*}
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Lower bound}

\begin{Claim}
	In any random graph we can find arbitrarily large parameter set that belongs to $A$.
\end{Claim}

This shows that

\begin{align*}
	\vc(\phi) \geq \vc_\AA(\phi) \geq \floor{\frac{Y}{\epsilon_L}}
\end{align*}

\begin{Claim}
	We can find a minimal extension $M / \{x, y\}$ with arbitrarily small dimension.
\end{Claim}

This shows that vc function is infinite in Shelah-Spencer random graphs.

\begin{align*}
	\vc(n) = \infty
\end{align*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Upper bound on $\AA$}

Let $n$ be the integer such that $n \epsilon_U < Y$ and $(n+1) \epsilon_U > Y$.

Pick a trace of $\phi(x,y)$ on $A^{|x|}$ by a parameter $b$.

\begin{align*}
	B = \curly{a \in A^{|x|} \mid \phi(a, b)}
\end{align*}

Pick $B' \subset B$, ordered $B' = \{a_i\}_{i \in I}$ such that
\begin{align*}
	%a_i \cap \bigcup_{j \neq i} a_j \neq \emptyset
	a_i \cap \bigcup_{j < i} a_j \neq \emptyset
\end{align*}
This is always possible by starting with $B$ and taking away elements one by one.
Call such a set a \emph{generating set} of $B$.

Let $M_i / \{a_i, b\}$ be a witness of $\phi(a_i, b)$ for each $i \in I$.
Let $\bar M = \bigcup M_i$.
Consider $\bar M / A$.

Pick $\bar M$ such that $\dim(\bar M / A)$ is maximized.

$\bar M \cap A \leq \bar M$ as $A$ is strong. (Make sure $M$ is not too big!)
Let $\bar A = A - \curly{a_i}_{i \in I}$.
Suppose $\bar A \cap \bar M \neq \emptyset$.
Then we can abstractly reembed $\M$ over $A$ such that $\bar A \cap \bar M = \emptyset$.
This would increase the dimension, contradicting maximality.
Thus we can assume $A \cap \bar M = \{a_i\}_{i \in I}$

Let $\bar M_j = \bigcup_{i < j} M_i$.

\begin{Lemma}
	$\dim(\bar M_j / A) \leq j \cdot \epsilon_U$
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Proceed by induction.
	Base case is clear.

	For induction case apply lemma to $\bar M_j \cup \{a_j\}$ and $M_j / \{a_j, b\}$.
	There are two cases
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $M_j \subset \bar M' \cup \{a_j\}$.
		In this case there are edges between $\{a_j\}$ and $M_j$ that contribute to dimension less than $-\epsilon_U$.
		\item Otherwise $M_j$ adds extra dimension less than $-\epsilon_U$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

Thus we have $\dim(\bar M / A) = \dim(\bar M_n / A) \leq -\epsilon_U n$.

Thus as $A$ is strong we need $|B'| \epsilon_U < Y$.
This gives us $|B'| \leq n$.
Finally we need to relate $|B'|$ to $|B|$.

Suppose we have $C \subset A^{|x|}$, finite with $|C| = N$.
A generating set for a trace has to have size $\leq n$.
Thus there are ${N \choose n} \leq N^n$ choices for a generating set.
A set generated from set of size $n$ can have at most $(x|n|)^{|x|}$ elements.
Thus a given set of size $n$ can generate at most
\begin{align*}
	2^{(x|n|)^{|x|}}
\end{align*}
sets.
Thus the number of possible traces on $C$ is bounded above by
\begin{align*}
  2^{(x|n|)^{|x|}} \cdot N^n = O(N^n)
\end{align*}
This bounds the vc-density by $n$.

\begin{align*}
	\vc_\AA(\phi) \geq \floor{\frac{Y}{\epsilon_U}}
\end{align*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Upper bound}

%Let $n$ be the integer such that $n \epsilon_U < Y$ and $(n+1) \epsilon_U > Y$.

Pick a trace of $\phi(x,y)$ on $A^{|x|}$ by a parameter $b$.
After throwing away at most $|A|$ many traces we may assume $b \notin A$.

Let
\begin{align*}
	A_b = \curly{a \in A^{|x|} \mid \phi(a, b)}
\end{align*}

Enumerate $A_b = \curly{a_i}_{i \leq I}$.
Let $M_i / \{a_i, b\}$ be a witness of $\phi(a_i, b)$ for each $i \leq I$.
Let $\bar M = \bigcup M_i$.
Consider $\bar M / A$.

\begin{Definition}
	Define the boundary of $M$ over $A$
	\begin{align*}
		\partial(M, A) = \curly{a \in A \mid \text{there is an edge between $a$ and element of $M - A$}}
	\end{align*}
\end{Definition}

Let $\bar M_i = \bigcup_{j < i} M_j$.
%Let $d_i = \dim(\bar M_i/A)$.
\begin{align*}
	m_i = |\{j < i \mid 
	&\bar M_j \cap A \neq \bar M_{j-1} \cap A \text{ or }\\
	&\partial(\bar M_j, A) \neq \partial(\bar M_{j-1}, A)\}|
\end{align*}

\begin{Lemma}
	\begin{align*}
		\dim(\bar M_i / (A \cup b)) &\leq -m_i \cdot \epsilon_U \\
		|\partial(\bar M_i, A)| &\leq m_i \cdot |M| \\
		|\bar M_j \cap A| &\leq m_i \cdot |M|
	\end{align*}
\end{Lemma}


\begin{proof}
	Proceed by induction.
	Second and third propositions are clear.
	For the first proposition base case is clear.
	
	Induction step.
	Suppose $\bar M_j \cap A = \bar M_{j+1}$ and $\partial(\bar M_j, A) = \partial(\bar M_{j+1}, A)$.
	Then $m_i = m_{i+1}$ and the quantities don't change.
	Thus assume at least one of these equalities fails.
	
	Apply Lemma \ref{chain_lemma} to $\bar M_j \cup A$ and $(M_{j+1}, a_{j+1})$.
	There are two options
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\dim(\bar M_{j+1} \cup A / \bar M_i \cup A) \leq -\epsilon_U$.
		This implies the proposition.
		\item $M_{j+1} \subset \bar M_j \cup A$.
		Then by our assumption it has to be $\partial(\bar M_j, A) \neq \partial(\bar M_{j+1}, A)$.
		There are edges between $M_{j+1} \cap (\partial(\bar M_{j+1}, A) - \partial(\bar M_j, A))$ so they contribute some negative dimension $\leq \epsilon_U$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

Let $m = m_I$.
Thus we have $\dim(\bar M / (A \cup b)) = \leq -m \cdot \epsilon_U $.
Thus as $A$ is strong we need $I \cdot \epsilon_U < Y$.
Let $W = \frac{|M|Y}{\epsilon_U}$.
\begin{align*}
	|\partial(\bar M, A)| &\leq m \cdot |M| \leq W \\
	|\bar M \cap A| &\leq m \cdot |M| \leq W
\end{align*}

Now, classify every trace by the isomorphism class of $\bar M - A \cup \partial(\bar M, A)$ and by $\partial(\bar M, A)$.
\begin{Lemma}
	Suppose we have traces $b_1, b_2$ with the same components as above.
	Then $A_{b_1} = A_{b_2}$.
\end{Lemma}

Consider $\bar M - A \cup \partial(\bar M, A)$.
Number of vertices is $\leq (2W)^2$.
Thus number of isomorphism classes $\leq 2^{(2W)^2}$.

Consider $\partial(\bar M, A)$.
Let $N = |A|$.
Order matters, so the total number of choices for it is
\begin{align*}
	N \cdot (N-1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (N - W + 1) = \frac{N!}{(N-W)!}
\end{align*}

Thus the number of possible different traces is bounded by 
\begin{align*}
	2^{(2W)^2} \cdot \frac{N!}{(N-W)!} = O(N^W)
\end{align*}

Since choice of $A$ was arbitrary, this gives
\begin{align*}
	\vc{\phi} \leq W = \frac{|M|Y}{\epsilon_U}
\end{align*}

\section{Technical Lemmas}

\begin{Lemma}
	Suppose we have a set $B$ and a minimal pair $(M, A)$ with $A \subset B$ and $\dim(M/A) = -\epsilon$.
Then either $M \subseteq B$ or $\dim((M \cup B)/B) < -\epsilon$.
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof}
	By diamond construction

	\begin{align*}
		\dim((M \cup B)/B) \leq \dim(M / (M \cap B))
	\end{align*}

	and 

	\begin{align*}
		\dim(M / (M \cap B)) &= \dim (M/A) - \dim(M / (M \cap B)) \\
		\dim (M/A) &= -\epsilon \\
		\dim(M / (M \cap B)) &> 0
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}



\begin{Lemma}	\label{chain_lemma}
	Suppose we have a set $B$ and a minimal chain $M_n$ with $M_0 \subset B$ and dimensions $-\epsilon_i$.
Let $\epsilon$ be the minimal of $\epsilon_i$.
Then either $M_n \subseteq B$ or $\dim((M_n \cup B)/B) < -\epsilon$.
\end{Lemma}


\begin{proof}
	Let $\bar M_i = M_i \cup B$

	\begin{align*}
		\dim(\bar M_n/B) = \dim(\bar M_n/\bar M_{n-1}) + \ldots + \dim(\bar M_2/\bar M_1) + \dim(\bar M_1/B)
	\end{align*}

	Either $M_n \subseteq B$ or one of the summands above is nonzero.
	Apply previous lemma.
\end{proof}
