abstract="We give an explicit AE-axiomatization of the almost sure theories of sparse random graphs G(n, n                âˆ’$\alpha$) of Shelah-Spencer. In the process we give a method of constructing extensions of graphs whose `relative dimension' is negative, but arbitrarily small. We describe the existentially closed and locally finite models of the theory and produce types of dimension zero. We offer a useful characterization of forking and generalize results about stability and the Dimensional Order Property (DOP) that were known for graphs to arbitrary relational languages.",
